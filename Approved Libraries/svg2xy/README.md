SVG 2 XY Coordinate Converter
=============================

No need to run a server for this to work.
just open any svg file in a text editor and copy all the text into the text area in the html page.

*this is a very specific library right now and only works for an svg file with the dimensions 315 x 381. This will not run on a node server either because it uses the browser's parseXML() function to convert the svg. *
